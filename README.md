# Real-Estate-Portal-JEE
Real estate portal developed using Java Enterprise Edition 


I developed my application that it is a website based on J2EE technology and this allows the user to see the different information about the available real estate ads, it also offered a registration form for creating a user account for people who want to post ads and become website note individuals. A form for those who want to do a search according to their desires like the type of property, the type of transaction (sale or rental), the surface, the city, the region and the maximum price of the property. My web application also includes two other forms, one for the connection by entering the userâ€™s email and password, and the other for the submission or publication of a new announcement
